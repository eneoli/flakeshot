# What is `flakeshot`?

`flakeshot` is a screenshot-tool for unix-systems which runs natively on `Wayland` *and* `X11`.

# Motivation
We all know some screenshot tools like [flameshot] (for X11) or [grim] (for Wayland) but they
were often only either for X11 *or* Wayland. `flakeshot` should close this gap by being a screenshot
tool which should run on X11 as good as on Wayland.

# Status
`flakeshot` is still under heavy development and not considered useable.
